      setthisprojectile only affects the specific projectile

==1.2.2==
 - Updated to current JFDuke3D and engine, which brings the following:

 - Added sound_pitch member to player struct
 - Added EVENT_NEXTWEAPON, EVENT_PREVIOUSWEAPON, EVENT_SWIMUP and EVENT_SWIMDOWN
 - Added multi-purpose event "64" which runs on all sprites in the game, allowing for
   manipulation of virtually everything in the game world
 - Added user-definable colored fog: simply add lines similar to the following to your duke3d.def:
   fogpal <palette number> <red intensity> <green intensity> <blue intensity>
   Intensities range from 0-63, and palettes 26, 27, 28 and 29 are pre-defined for you as
   white, red, green and blue respectively.  Sector visibility controls fog density.
 - Added movement_lock[] member to player struct.  Functionality will be explained upon request
   until the wiki is updated.  As can be guessed, this is used to lock player movement.
 - Fixed a couple of reload bugs
 - Projectile system internally optimized and improved (ripped out remnants of variable based
   system as well as modified the system to restore projectile defaults on game restart)
 - Added the following primitives:
    - movesprite 
    - checkavailweapon
    - updatesectorz
    - ssp
    - stopallsounds
    - soundoncevar
    - stopsoundvar 
   Movesprite, checkavailweapon, updatesectorz and ssp work exactly as their
   internal counterparts do.  The sound commands are self-explanatory.
 - Minor fixes to the error handling system -- it is now impossible to redefine internal
   pointer gamevars.  Some error messages also made more descriptive.
 - Fixed handling of bad CON files
 - Added "-condebug" command line parameter which prints one line to the init window per line
   compiled.  This is useful in cases where you've encountered a bug in the CON parser which
   throws you into an infinite loop on compile, as you can see where the problem happened.
 - Fixed "DNITEMS" cheat not triggering item cheat events
 - CON commands "addlog" and "addlogvar" now print to console and log to eduke32.log
   with all of the other log information rather than log.log
 - Fixed multiplayer menu problem
 - Added PROJECTILE_FLAG_RPG_IMPACT (defined as 32768) to projectile flags.  This flag causes
   an RPG type projectile to directly damage whatever it hits rather than do radius damage.
 - By request, changed how Duke moves when submerging into and emerging from underwater sectors
 - Various minor code clean-ups and fixes

 - Mapster32 changes:
    - Added ' 5 2D mode key combination for changing the shade of every parallaxed ceiling
      on the map at once
    - Added ' 6 2D mode key combination for changing the height of every parallaxed ceiling
      on the map at once
    - Added ' Z 2D mode key combination for offsetting an entire map on the Z plane.  This
      is useful for merging sections of maps into other maps.
    - Added Left ALT ' 7 2D mode key combination for scaling the entire map (multiply)
    - Added Left ALT ' 8 2D mode key combination for scaling the entire map (divide)
    - Added ' M key combination for setting .extra member (this is the SW middle tag)
    - Help menus re-organized to be more useful
    - Added ' P 3D mode key combination to set palette on all sectors selected in 2D mode
    - Added ; V 3D mode key combination to set visibility on all sectors selected in 2D mode
    - Added support for running without lookup.dat (obviously, this will disable alt pals)

 - Updated to current JFDuke3D and JFBuild release, see releasenotes.html for details
 - Mapster32 updated to 1.0.1, hit F1 in 2D mode for new feature rundown

   bullet hole was left on a wall.

    - whilevarvarn
    - hitscan
    - getplayervar
    - setplayervar
    - mulscale
    - setaspect
   Descriptions of these commands will be available soon on EDukeWiki
