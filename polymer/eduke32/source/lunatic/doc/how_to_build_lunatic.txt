
Lunatic depends on the following:

* LuaJIT 2.0.2 or later [http://luajit.org]. It is recommended to get the
  latest git HEAD of the 2.0 branch, see http://luajit.org/download.html for
  that. As of time of writing, LuaJIT 2.1 is in alpha, and has not been
  successfully tested with Lunatic. LuaJIT is built with the following change
  to src/luaconf.h:
    #define LUAI_MAXCSTACK 64000
  (instead of the default 8000.)

* LPeg 0.12 [http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg], but with our patch
  "lpeg-lunatic.patch" applied. It will allow to build a statically linked
  library of LPeg, "liblpeg.a".  On Windows, liblpeg.a is pre-compiled and
  resides in platform/Windows/lib/.
